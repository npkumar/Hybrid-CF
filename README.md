# Hybrid-CF
Optimastion for CF Algorithm using CBR, GA and SOM clustering

## Abstract
Collaborative filtering (CF) is widely used in recommendation systems. Traditional collaborative filtering (CF) algorithms 
face two major challenges: data sparsity and scalability. In this study, we propose a hybrid method based on item based CF 
trying to achieve a more personalized product recommendation for a user while addressing some of these challenges. 
Case Based Reasoning (CBR) combined with average filling is used to handle the sparsity of data set, while Self-Organizing Map 
(SOM) optimized with Genetic Algorithm (GA) performs user clustering in large datasets to reduce the scope for item-based CF. 
The proposed method shows encouraging results when evaluated and compared with the traditional item based CF algorithm.
